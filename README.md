# MOLECULAR SYNTHESIS & RECONSTRUCTION

This is the Python repository about the Deep Learning And Applied Artificial Intelligence Project 2019/2020 in the Computer Science Master's Degree course of La Sapienza University of Rome.


## Goal Description

The goal was to develop Deep Learning models that can reconstruct molecules as best as possible and generate new molecules. The idea was to analyze the paper [[1]](#1): choose a representation of the molecules among the proposed one, choose a type of model and try different models of the same type (*RNN*, *VAE*, *AAE*, *GAN* ..) and choose different metrics on which evaluate models. The actual goal has been to get models that rebuild and generate new ones in a good enough way compared to other models that are state of the art.

The whole project is divided into parts:
- Molecular Representation & Dataset
- Preprocessing
- Models Building and Training 
- Molecules Reconstruction
- Molecules Synthesis
